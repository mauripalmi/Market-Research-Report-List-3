<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Tension Screen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transversal Tension</li><li>Longitudinal Tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane tension screens are used in mining and aggregate industries for screening purposes. Transversal tension screens are constructed with the tension wires running perpendicular to the side walls, providing efficient screening of material across the width of the screen. Longitudinal tension screens, on the other hand, have tension wires running parallel to the side walls, allowing for effective screening along the length of the screen. Both types of tension screens offer high durability, abrasion resistance, and efficient screening performance.</p></p>
