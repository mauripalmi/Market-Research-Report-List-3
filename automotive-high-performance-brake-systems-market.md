<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive High-Performance Brake Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake System</li><li>Disc Brake System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive high-performance brake systems come in two main types: drum brake systems and disc brake systems. Drum brake systems use brake shoes that press against the inside of a rotating drum to slow down or stop the vehicle. On the other hand, disc brake systems use brake pads that squeeze against a rotor to achieve the same result. Disc brake systems are generally considered more efficient and effective at dissipating heat, making them a popular choice in high-performance vehicles.</p></p>
