<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Latent tuberculosis Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)</li><li>Interferon Gamma Released Assay (IGRA)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Latent tuberculosis testing involves two main types of tests: Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and Interferon Gamma Released Assay (IGRA). TST involves injecting a small amount of tuberculin beneath the skin and observing for a local reaction, while IGRA measures the release of interferon-gamma in response to tuberculosis antigens. Both tests are used to detect latent tuberculosis infection, which can progress to active tuberculosis if left untreated. These tests play a crucial role in diagnosing and managing tuberculosis infections worldwide.</p></p>
