<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental sutures are used in dental procedures to hold tissues together while they heal. There are two main types of dental sutures: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable sutures are designed to break down and be absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for removal. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, do not break down and must be removed manually by a dental professional. Each type has its own benefits and drawbacks, depending on the specific needs of the patient and the procedure being performed.</p></p>
