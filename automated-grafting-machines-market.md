<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Grafting Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Automatic</li><li>Semi Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated grafting machines come in two main types: fully automatic and semi-automatic. Fully automatic machines are able to perform the entire grafting process without any human intervention, from cutting to joining the plant tissues. On the other hand, semi-automatic machines require some level of human input, such as placing the scion and rootstock in the machine before the grafting process begins. Both types of machines offer efficiency and precision in grafting, but fully automatic machines are generally considered to be more advanced and require less manual labor.</p></p>
