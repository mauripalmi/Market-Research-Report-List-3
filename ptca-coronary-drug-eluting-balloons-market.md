<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTCA Coronary Drug Eluting Balloons Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DEB Balloon</li><li>Standard Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PTCA Coronary Drug-Eluting Balloon (DEB) market involves a specialized type of balloon used in angioplasty procedures to deliver drugs directly to the affected arteries, reducing the risk of restenosis. DEB balloons are designed to release drugs that inhibit cell growth and prevent the arteries from narrowing again. In contrast, standard balloons used in angioplasty do not have this drug-delivery capability and rely solely on physical expansion to open the blocked arteries. Both types of balloons are important tools in the treatment of coronary artery disease.</p></p>
