<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atmospheric Pressure Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absolute Pressure Sensor</li><li>Relative Pressure Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atmospheric Pressure Sensor market includes two main types: Absolute Pressure Sensor and Relative Pressure Sensor. Absolute Pressure Sensors measure pressure relative to a perfect vacuum, while Relative Pressure Sensors measure pressure relative to the ambient atmospheric pressure. Absolute Pressure Sensors are used in applications where precise pressure measurements are required, such as altimeters. Relative Pressure Sensors, on the other hand, are used in applications where changes in pressure are more important than the actual pressure value, such as in weather monitoring systems.</p></p>
