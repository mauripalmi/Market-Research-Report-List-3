<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Three Phase Electricity Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial three phase electricity smart meters are classified into two types: IC card and non-IC card markets. IC card smart meters require users to prepay for electricity by loading money onto a card, which is then inserted into the meter to access power. Non-IC card smart meters on the other hand, allow for postpaid billing where users are billed at the end of a billing period based on their actual electricity consumption. Both types of smart meters provide accurate monitoring and control of electricity usage in commercial settings.</p></p>
