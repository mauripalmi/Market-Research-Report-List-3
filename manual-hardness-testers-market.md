<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Hardness Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rockwell Hardness Tester</li><li>Brinell Hardness Tester</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Manual hardness testers are commonly categorized into two main types: Rockwell and Brinell testers. </p><p>Rockwell hardness testers measure the depth of indentation left by a specific type of indenting tool under a specific load, providing a quick and accurate measurement of hardness. </p><p>On the other hand, Brinell hardness testers apply a specific load on a carbide ball to create an indentation on the material’s surface. The diameter of the indentation is then measured to calculate the hardness of the material. </p><p>Both types of testers are widely used in various industries for quality control and material testing purposes.</p></p>
