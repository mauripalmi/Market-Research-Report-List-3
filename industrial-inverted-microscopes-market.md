<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Inverted Microscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Episcopic Type</li><li>Diascopic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial inverted microscopes come in two main types: episcopic and diascopic. Episcopic microscopes have the light source above the specimen, allowing for observation of opaque or reflective samples. Diascopic microscopes have the light source below the specimen, making them ideal for transparent samples. Both types of microscopes are widely used in industries such as electronics, materials science, and biology for detailed examination and analysis of samples. The choice between episcopic and diascopic types depends on the nature of the sample being observed.</p></p>
