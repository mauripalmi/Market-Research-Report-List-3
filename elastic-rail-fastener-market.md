<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elastic Rail Fastener Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concrete Pillow Fastener</li><li>Buckle Plate Fastener</li><li>Spring Fastener</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Elastic rail fasteners are used in railway tracks to secure the rails to the underlying base. There are three main types of elastic rail fasteners: concrete pillow fasteners, buckle plate fasteners, and spring fasteners. Concrete pillow fasteners use a rubber pad sandwiched between two concrete blocks to absorb rail vibrations. Buckle plate fasteners use a metal plate that grips the rail base, while spring fasteners use adjustable springs to provide elasticity. Each type of fastener has its own advantages and is suitable for different railway track conditions.</p></p>
