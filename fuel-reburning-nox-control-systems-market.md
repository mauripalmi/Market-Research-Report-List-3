<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Reburning NOx Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Reaction</li><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Reaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fuel Reburning NOx Control Systems are technologies used to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in industrial processes. Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Reaction involves injecting ammonia or urea into the combustion process to react with NOx and reduce emissions. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Reaction uses a catalyst such as vanadium or platinum to convert NOx into nitrogen and water. SCR is more effective at reducing NOx emissions, but both technologies are widely used in industries to comply with environmental regulations.</p></p>
