<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Generators in Fire Protection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Swing Adsorption</li><li>Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen generators are devices used in fire protection systems to provide a reliable source of nitrogen gas for fire suppression. Two common types of nitrogen generators in the market are Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and Membrane systems. </p><p>PSA generators separate nitrogen from compressed air by adsorbing oxygen molecules, while Membrane generators use a semi-permeable membrane to separate nitrogen from other gases. Both systems are effective in producing high-purity nitrogen for use in fire protection applications and are chosen based on specific project requirements.</p></p>
